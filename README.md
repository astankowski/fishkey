## Features
### üìö Leitner System (Spaced Repetition)
Fishkey uses the **Leitner System** for efficient flashcard learning. This technique, introduced by German journalist **Sebastian Leitner** in 1972, ensures optimal memorization by sorting flashcards into learning stages based on recall accuracy.

**How It Works:**
1. Flashcards are divided into levels based on user performance.
2. If a card is answered correctly, it moves to the next level (reviewed less frequently).
3. If answered incorrectly, it moves back to the first level (reviewed more frequently).
4. Over time, difficult cards are reviewed more often, reinforcing memory.

### ü§ñ AI-Generated Flashcards
- Users can enter a term (front of the card), and AI generates a definition (back of the card).
- This helps accelerate the flashcard creation process.
